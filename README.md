# NBA Performance and Prediction Analysis

Machine learning has been implemented into various aspects of life and this project aims to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be utilised in the NBA to determine the set of players 
that perform the best(outliers) and use it to predict the outcome of two teams based on previous history...

## Dataset

Our analysis draws from a rich set of data files containing player, team, and coaching statistics:

1. **Player Data**
   - `player_regular_season.txt`
   - `player_regular_season_career.txt`
   - `player_playoffs.txt`
   - `player_playoff_career.txt`
   - `player_allstar.txt`

2. **Team Data**
   - `team_season.txt`
   - `teams.txt`

3. **Draft Data**
   - `draft.txt`

4. **Coaching Data**
   - `coaches_season.txt`
   - `coaches_career.txt`

## Usage Guide

This project contains two main components:

1. **Outcome Prediction Model**
   - A Python-based model to predict game outcomes between two teams based on a range of features from player and team history.

2. **Outlier Detection Model**
   - Identifies standout players who significantly exceed average performance, using machine learning techniques to mark them as outliers.
